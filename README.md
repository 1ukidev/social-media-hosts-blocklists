# Social Media Hosts Blocklists

Social media hosts blocklists I use for my Firewall and [AdAway](https://github.com/AdAway/AdAway) on my mobile devices, but they also work for many other blockers.  
Can be fed into [stevenblack-hosts-trimmed](https://github.com/cyb3rko/stevenblack-hosts-trimmed).

It currently contains bocklists for:
- Discord
- Facebook
- Instagram
- Pinterest
- Telegram
- TikTok (and related Bytedance services)
- Twitter
